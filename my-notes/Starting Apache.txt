Starting Apache:

The httpd program is run as a "daemon" that executes continuously in the background to handle requests.

How Apache starts:
------------------

If the Listen, specified in the configuration file is default of 80 (or any other port below 1024), then it is necessary
to have root privileges in order to start apache, so that it can bind to this privileged port.

Once the server has started and performed a few priliminery steps such as opening its log files, it will launch several child
processes which do the work of listening for and answering requests from client.

The main httpd process continues to run as the root user. But, the child processess run as a less privileged user.

This is controlled by the selected Multi-Processing Module.

Some examples of Multi-Processing Modules in UNIX:

1) prefork
2) worker
3) event


Recommended method of invoking the httpd executable is to use the "apachect1" control script.

This script sets certain environment variables that are necessary for the httpd to function correctly under some operating systems.
and then invokes the httpd binary. 

apachect1 will pass through any command line arguments, so any httpd options may also be included with apachect1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first thing that httpd does when it is invoked is to locate and read the configuration file "httpd.conf". The location of this 
file is set at compile time, but it is possible to specify its location at run time using the -f command line option as in

/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachect1 -f /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


If all goes well during startup, the server will detach from the terminal and the command prompt will return almost
immediately. This indicates that the server is up and running. You can then use the web-browser to connect to the server
and test the page in the "DocumentRoot" directory.
