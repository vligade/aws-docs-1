What is Clean Code ?
----------------------

Inventor of C++.....
---------------------
I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The logic to be straight forward to make it hard for bugs to hide.

The dependencies minimal to ease maintanence, error handling complete according to articulated strategy.... 

And performance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprinciple optimizations....

Clean code does one thing well !!!


------> Bad code tempts the mess to grow !! When others change bad code, they tend to make it worse !!

------> Bad code tries to do too much, it has muddled intent and ambiguity of purpose. 

\\ Clean code is focused \\

    ----> Each function, each class, each module exposes a single-minded attitude that remains entirely undistracted,
            and polluted, by the surrounding details.

Another book author....
------------------------

    Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose.

    Clean code never obscures the designer's intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straight forward lines of control.

        -----> Our code should be matter-of-fact as opposed to be speculative. It should contain only, what is necessary.

Father of Eclipse Strategy....
-------------------------------


    Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. It has unit and acceptance tests.

    It has meaningful names.

    It provides one way rather than many ways for doing one thing.

    It has minimal dependencies, which is explicitly defined, and provides a clear and minimal API.

    Code should be literate since depending on the language, not all necesarry information can be expressed clearly in code alone.


Author of .. Working Effectively with Legacy Code
---------------------------------------------------

    Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares.

    There is nothing obvious that you can do to make it better.

    All of those things were thought about by the code's author, and if you try to imagine improvements, you're lead back to
    where you are, sitting in appreciation of the code someone left for you - code left by someone who cares deeply about the
    craft.

    -------------->-------------->------------>------------>

        1. Clean code is code that has been taken care of.

        2. Someone has taken time to keep it simlple and orderly.

        3. They have paid appropriate attention to details. 

        4. They have cared.!!!

    -------------->-------------->------------>------------>



Another author says.....
------------------------

    1. Runs all the tests

    2. Contains no duplication

    3. Expresses all the design ideas that are in the system;

    4. Minimizes the number of entities such as classes, methods, functions and the like. 


God father of all those who care about code
--------------------------------------------

    You know you are working on clean code, when each routine you read, turns out to be pretty much, what you expected.

    You can call it beautiful code when the code also makes it look like language was made for the problem.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THERE IS NO WAY TO WRITE CODE WITHOUT READING IT, SO MAKING IT EASY TO READ ACTUALLY MAKES IT EASIER TO WRITE.
