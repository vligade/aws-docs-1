Application Types:
------------------

Applications are broadly classified into 2 types;

1) Monolithic Architecture -- Where an appllication is built as a single unit.

2) Microservices Architecture -- Where many applications (microservices) handle a small portion of the 
functionality and data.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
According to Gartner Hype Cycle for Application Services, 2016, Microservices
is rated "AT THE PEAK".

Monolithic Style:
-----------------

A Monolithic application is built as a 'single unit', i.e., one big application in a single language
that handles all of the functionality, data, business logic etc. A load balancer distributes requests
from the end user, across multiple machines, each running one instance of our application.

All logic for handling a request runs in a single process, allowing you to use the basic features 
of language to divide up the application into classes, functions, and namespaces.
